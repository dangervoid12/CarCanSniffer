Java/Swing/arduino/mcp2515

Hi all!
This project will let you communicate with car canbus.
Project is divided into two sections. First one is 
atmega firmware decoding canbus signals from car to serial output. 

Arduino wiring as follow:

PC          
USB---------Arduino                   MCP2515             CAR OBD2
            2-------------------------INT   CAN H----------6
            13------------------------SCK   CAN L----------14
            11------------------------SI
            12------------------------SO
            10------------------------CS
            5V------------------------VCC
            GND-----------------------GND



In CarCanSnifferArduino you can find ready to go arduino sketch. You can upload it using ie. ArduinoSdk
CarCanSniffer was made in java, IntelliJ.
Happy to help if any questions.
